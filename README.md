## Answers to questions:
1. Three things learned:
    -Complex calendar grid implementations with CSS Grid
    -Drag-and-drop event handling in React
    -Local state persistence with localStorage

2. Most difficult part:    
    -Implementing the drag-to-resize functionality while maintaining event date consistency
    -To keep track of the lane so that the current event doesn't merge or become inconsistent for the user

3. With more time:
    -Add event overlap handling
    -Add undo/redo functionality
    -use nodemailer to inform about the events
